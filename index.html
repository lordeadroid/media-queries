          For some time after its birth, it uses the nutrients that are packed
          into the seed on its back in order to grow.
          <br />

          It carries a seed on its back right from birth. As its body grows
          larger, the seed does too.

          The more sunlight Ivysaur bathes in, the more strength wells up within
          it, allowing the bud on its back to grow larger.
          <br />
          The bulb on its back grows as it absorbs nutrients. The bulb gives off
          a pleasant aroma when it blooms.

        <p>
          While it basks in the sun, it can convert the light into energy. As a
          result, it is more powerful in the summertime.
          <br />
          By spreading the broad petals of its flower and catching the sun’s
          rays, it fills its body with power.

        <p>
          The flame on its tail shows the strength of its life-force. If
          Charmander is weak, the flame also burns weakly.
          <br />
          If Charmander is healthy, the flame on the tip of its tail will burn
          vigorously and won’t go out even if it gets a bit wet.

        <p>
          When it swings its burning tail, the temperature around it rises
          higher and higher, tormenting its opponents.
          <br />
          It is very hotheaded by nature, so it constantly seeks opponents to
          battle against. Its aggression will not be quelled if it doesn’t win.

        <p>
          If Charizard becomes truly angered, the flame at the tip of its tail
          burns in a light blue shade.
          <br />
          It uses its wings to fly sky-high. The more experience it gains in
          battle, the greater the temperature at which its flames burn.

        <p>
          After birth, its back swells and hardens into a shell. It sprays a
          potent foam from its mouth.
          <br />
          Its shell is soft immediately after it is born. In no time at all, the
          shell becomes so resilient that a prodding finger will bounce right
          off it.

          Wartortle’s long, furry tail is a symbol of longevity, so this Pokémon
          is quite popular among older people.
          <br />
          It often hides in water to stalk unwary prey. While swimming quickly,
          it moves its ears to maintain balance.

        <p>
          It deliberately increases its body weight so it can withstand the
          recoil of the water jets it fires.
          <br />
          It has jet nozzles on its shell. This impressive Pokémon uses these
          jets to charge toward foes with all the force of a rocket.

        <p>
          For protection, it releases a horrible stench from the antenna on its
          head to drive away enemies.
          <br />
          Its short feet are tipped with suction pads that enable it to
          tirelessly climb slopes and walls.
